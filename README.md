## Building Websites with AI
I used CANVA mainly to draft layout ideas and I used AI generate small CSS snippets and explain what the code is telling the computer. AI helped me prototype faster, but I always review and adjust the output to match my design decisions — I treat AI as a helper-teacher, I am author and student.

## Interview Question
Describe a challenge and solution:

I resolved this by switching the layout to CSS Grid with auto-fit and applying the contact-photo to reduce thumbnail size and stack captions on smaller screens. This kept the layout balanced and readable across devices.
